# Run the Bots
## Requirements:
You will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (recommended v8.12.0 LTS)

## Steps
1. Clone the repo. 

    You can use programs like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or simply download the project, although you won't be able to submit changes as easily.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TimRuswick/SANCTUM
    ```

2. Rename the `.envdev` file to `.env`, and fill out tokens and channels. 

    Make sure you save it, and also don't push any of your tokens here! If you do though, consider them compromised and then reset them. On Windows, you must give the .env file a name, but you can circumvent it by using a program like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to rename files!

3. Navigate via command-line to a bot's folder, install dependancies, and run it!

    Make sure you're in the project folder!
    On Windows, you can hold Shift and Right Click the folder to get the option of a command prompt, inside that folder.
    ```bash
    cd "SANCTUM"    # Navigate to project folder
    npm i           # For modules dependancies
    cd "A.D.A.M."   # Choose a bot
    npm i           # Install dependancies
    node adam.js    # Run the bot
    ```

4. ???

5. Profit! You did it, unless something has happened along the way. ~~Developer luck says yes.~~

## Quality of Life

We recommend [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for reloading bots automatically, instead of `Ctrl+C`ing in and out of bots when you need a restart.
