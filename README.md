# Run the bots
## Requirements:
You will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (recommended v8.12.0 LTS)

## Steps
1. Clone the repo. 

    You can use programs like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or simply download the project, although you won't be able to submit changes as easily.

2. Rename the `.envdev` file to `.env`, and fill out tokens and channels. 

    Make sure you save it, and also don't push any of your tokens here! If you do though, consider them comprimised and then reset them.

3. Navigate via command-line to a bot's folder, install dependancies, and run it!

    Make sure you're in the project folder!
    On Windows, you can hold Shift and Right Click the folder to get the option of a command prompt, inside that folder.
    ```bash
    # You have to be in the project folder first to navigate through it
    cd "A.D.A.M."
    npm i
    node adam.js
    ```

4. ???

5. Profit! You did it, unless something has happened along the way. ~~Probably likely, sadly.~~

## Quality of Life

We recommend [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for reloading bots automatically, instead of `Ctrl+C`ing in and out of bots when you need a restart.
